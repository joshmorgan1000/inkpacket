# Inkpacket Implementation Status

## Overview
The inkpacket tool provides binary protection for applications by encrypting critical code components and embedding them within the main executable. The resulting binary becomes tamper-resistant - any modification causes the decryption to fail, preventing the application from running.

## Completed Features

### 1. Core Infrastructure
- ✅ CMakeLists.txt build configuration
- ✅ Header file with complete API definitions (`ink_packet.hpp`)
- ✅ Platform-specific implementations for Linux, macOS, and Windows

### 2. Encryption Integration
- ✅ AES-256-GCM encryption using Psyfer library
- ✅ ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption using Psyfer library
- ✅ Key derivation using HKDF-SHA256
- ✅ Secure random number generation for IVs/nonces

### 3. Hashing Integration
- ✅ SHA-256 hashing using Psyfer library
- ✅ SHA-512 hashing using Psyfer library
- ✅ CRC32 checksum for metadata verification

### 4. Binary Components
- ✅ `ink-pack`: Command-line tool for building protected binaries
- ✅ `ink-patch`: Post-build patcher for embedding payloads
- ✅ Runtime loader for decrypting and loading protected libraries
- ✅ Binary analysis and verification utilities

### 5. Protection Features
- ✅ Self-verification at runtime
- ✅ Anti-debugging detection (platform-specific)
- ✅ Memory protection utilities
- ✅ Integrity checking with timing attack resistance
- ✅ Background verification threads

### 6. Testing
- ✅ Basic test suite covering core functionality
- ✅ Test binary creation and patching workflow

## Architecture

### Binary Layout
```
[Application Binary] [Size: embedded_size]
[Metadata Structure] [64 bytes]
[Encrypted Payload]  [Variable size]
```

### Protection Flow
1. Build application and critical library separately
2. Hash the application binary
3. Derive encryption key from hash using HKDF
4. Encrypt the critical library with derived key
5. Append metadata and encrypted payload to binary
6. Patch size information into binary

### Runtime Flow
1. Read embedded size from patched location
2. Hash exactly that many bytes of the binary
3. Verify metadata checksum
4. Derive decryption key from hash
5. Decrypt payload into memory
6. Load decrypted library

## Security Features

- **Hash-as-Key**: The binary's own hash is used to derive the decryption key
- **Tamper Detection**: Any modification changes the hash, preventing decryption
- **Anti-Debugging**: Platform-specific debugger detection
- **Memory Protection**: Secure memory allocation and cleanup
- **Continuous Verification**: Background threads periodically re-verify integrity

## Usage Example

```bash
# Build a protected binary
ink-pack -o protected_app -c crypto.cpp -s utils.cpp main.cpp

# Or patch an existing binary
ink-patch myapp libcritical.so
```

## Implementation Notes

- Uses Psyfer's encryption and hashing algorithms exclusively
- All sensitive data is handled with proper memory protection
- Platform-specific code is isolated in separate source files
- Follows modern C++23 best practices with RAII and smart pointers

## Future Enhancements

- In-memory PE/ELF loading without temporary files
- Additional obfuscation layers
- Hardware fingerprinting for device-locked binaries
- Time-bomb functionality for expiring binaries
- Multi-layer encryption with different algorithms
